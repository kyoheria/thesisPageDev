So often people just assume I am straight female. Sometime people says ""that make up wouldn't attract male"" or ""you look cute today do you have data with your men?"" and I just find it uncomfortable and funny at the same time. Not like other girls do make up and dress up for men. In same time other LGBT community people just assume I am not one of them which feels like I do not belong anywhere.  ",Time I questioned myself's gender/sexuality,"I think I did this through out this project. It's beyond just sexuality and gender. I was wondering who am I and how would I communicate this wired nots I hold on for long time about identity. Gender, sexuality, and identity is something I want to keep question to my self.

I didn't really have ""Realization"" or anything like that but it made me think about it more and know about different types and such. ",Stereotypes I get because of my sexuality/gender identity,"Because I am a male (I identify as a male), people expect you are ""Stronger"" or more ""Courageous"" than female. Hence, sometimes there is un-said pressure, surrounding how I should take actions or volunteer to do something that I do not particularly would like to do. Also, with drinking culture, male is usually expected to drink more and such, even thought not everyone likes drinking or just because I am a male does not mean I want to party and drink.

Me as the main character would ALWAYS, ALWAYS be a boy, usually a feminine looking boy. A lot of my favorite characters were also feminine boys or girls who were disguised as boys, or tomboyish girls as well, because I was relating to characters who were the closest to what I wanted to be. At the time, little me only had the words ""very cool!!!!"" to describe why I liked them so much, and now I know it's because I wanted to be like them. ",College,No
