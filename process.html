                    <p>Created google form to explore the way to collect data and story. Sent to 5 people (I took it myself too). I decided to see how having the labels of nationality, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality would change the way people see the story, see the people they know. I think it affected me the most  because the format of the form let people to take time to answer and the story was very personal. I did not know what they were going through, what they were thinking, even though they are very close to me.</p>

                    <p>Website mock-up from scratch including the visualization, form, and process I have been taking. New forms that challenges users to really think about their identity. Instead of having multiple choices for gender and sexuality, I decided to incorporate multiple slider where user can place the dot to where they feel comfortable. Also asked to pick two topics to answer in short answer format. I also made some visualization using answers of older form. One that has people's labels next to their personal story, another that sorts the participating people to big 5 personality.</p>
