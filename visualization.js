Then I said well what if I like girls, too, and she said she saw in that moment the devil in my spirit. She looked at me like a stranger and told me never to bring it up again and never to tell the rest of my family. I didn't bring it up again. She will sometimes bring it up in weird ways like yelling at my for wearing different colored socks and saying \â€œwhy do you have to be so different all the time? Also I know that friend you have is gay...\'  However, 4 years later, I think she is coming around to it because recently she told me it would be good to find a \"partner\" and that \"it doesn\'t matter so much what they are like as long as they make you happy.\" She has said before how I look good in suits...

You feel like it should be such a scary thing cause in the ideal world, no one assumes that you are straight, they just assume you are a human being like everyone else. So to do this project, I needed to make a powerpoint to explain where I was in the project. And to try to explain why I am doing this I just came outstanding on the podium facing about 35 people. My hands didn't even stop shaking.Even though many of my classmates have already known this part of me it was scary. But life-changing too. Hearing everyone but clapping of getting quite personal stories as feedback, knowing that this classroom is a quite safe place that when I make gay jokes in the presentation, someone will get it and laugh. I am lucky one being able to feel safe to come out in front of the class. I am lucky that many of my friends was like \"ya, I knew\" or \"you finally said it\" or \"OMG I did not know but I am too!\" And coming out provided me much meaningful friendship for me. It might not sound so funny, but to me, I find it funny that I was so terrified cause I am so glad I have done it and it felt so much warmer than anything I expected.",RianObj));

I had a million letter drafts and spent so much time thinking over every little word I used. I was so terrified to tell them even though my parents have never been explicitly homophobic or transphobic. Ultimately, I was still afraid of their reaction. I instead made my eldest sister give them the letter after dinner while I was at my friends house. My mom was upset that I did not feel safe enough to tell her while I was there. My parents did not really understand why I feel the way I do. After I came home, I did not know how to talk to them about what I wrote in the letter. So, one day my mom just approached me asking if we were ever gonna talk about it. That was 3 years ago, and I still have a hard time talking to my parents about it.
